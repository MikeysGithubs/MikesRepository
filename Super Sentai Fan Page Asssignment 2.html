  <h2>Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger 1992</h2>
  <p>Jūrenjā, translated into English as <b>(Dinosaur Squadron Beast Ranger)</b>
    is the sixteenth installment in the Super Sentai franchise and the first Super Sentai series to be adapted into an installment of the American Power Rangers series.
     Footage from all 50 episodes were extensively used for the first season of <b> Morphin Power Rangers.</b>
     The Core 5 Zyuranger costumes were used in all three seasons of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and were used as the original Power Rangers costumes while the Dragon Ranger costume was used as the Green Ranger's costume throughout Season 1 and in early Season 2. 
     Zyuranger was a landmark series with the Super Sentai franchise, being the first series with a prehistoric animal motif, the first to incorporate fantasy elements instead of science fiction, 
     the first to feature a mecha comprised entirely of robotic animals, and the first to feature a sixth ranger character.</p>

 <h2>Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger Trailer</h2>
<a style=color:blue; href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfN4vgjuWKg"> Trailer Link</a>
  <h3>Premise of Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger</h3>
  <p>
    170,000,000 years ago, five ancient human tribes, with the protection of the Guardian Beasts, coexisted with the dinosaurs. 
    This ended when the evil Witch Bandora started a war on the dinosaurs because of the death of her son Kai.
    Bandora decided that the only way Kai's death could be avenged was if she sold her soul to Dai-Satan, an evil, 
    almost ice-like head creature who had immense power and who later in the series could be summoned by Bandora. 
    In the end, the five tribes were ruined and the dinosaurs became extinct.</p>

   <p> The Guardian Beasts sealed Bandora and her minions on the planet Nemesis before going into hibernation. 
    In 1992, Nemesis returned to Earth's orbit. 
    Two astronauts exploring the planet accidentally released her and her minions from their prison. 
    With Bandora free, her arch-enemy, the Mysterious Sage Barza retreated to his underground lair 2,000 meters below the apartment building where he worked as a front. 
    There, he revived the five Holy Warriors of Justice he had been guarding, who had been in suspended animation to be awakened when they were needed. 
    These five were each a member of the ancient human tribes, who coexisted with the dinosaurs. 
    With the aid of the Guardian Beasts, the Zyurangers fought Bandora and her Dora Monsters. 
    Later in the series, after the five had become used to modern times, the leader's big brother comes forth with tales of jealousy and vengeance. <cite> (RangerWiki)</cite>

<h2>Quotes from the cast</h2>
<h4>Zyuranger Cast Interview</h4>
<a style=color:blue; href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh1Per8LaLo">This is a Link to the Interview</a>
<br>
<p>"In my case, I was a gravure idol. I heard about the audition, being a girl I had no idea
    or any interest in <b>Sentai</b> or <b>Kamen Rider.</b> And when I went to the audition, There
    was the "Sentai" word so I  guessed there would be some fighting. I had no idea what it was, but I passed the audition" - <b>Reiko Chiba</b>
</p>
<p>"After coming back from America, I was poor and I begged, "Please give me a job." So a toy producer said "why don't you try out for this <b>"Sentai"</b> film that we are putting together? I said "Yes sir!!"
    and then I went to the audition and I met <i>Yuuta."</i> - <b>Seji Umon</b>
</p>
    
<p>
"I had been doing work related to Tokusatsu and I received the opportunity to audition for Zyuranger.
I went to the audition and passed. Back when I was little, 
the heroes were <b>Sun Vulcan,</b><b>Vul Panther</b> in particular.
I really admired Vul Panther and it was the reason why I entered this world" - <b>Takumi Hashimoto</b>

  <div>
    <br>
    Ishinomori born in December 1954 worked on various famous Japanese works in his early career including <b>Astro Boy</b>
    and <b>Alakazam the Great.</b> But after the success of the <b>tokusatsu</b> superhero TV series <b>Kamen rider,</b>
    produced by Toei company in 1971, 
    led to the birth of the birth of the "transforming" (henshin) superhero (human-sized superheroes who transform by doing a pose, and use martial arts to fight henchmen and the weekly monster), 
    and resulted in many sequel shows to this day. Ishinomori then created many similar superhero dramas, which were once again all produced by Toei or in Sarutobi Ecchan's case Toei Animation.
